## HR Analytics 

Applying advanced analytics to HR management decisions solves the problem of guesswork by using thousands of data points, gathered through statistically predictive assessments, to determine whether or not an employee will leave the company. While traditional metrics are important to understanding human resources, efficiency and performance, they are reactive measures. Predictive analytics can identify what will happen in the future or explain what drives that outcome, such as how likely an employee is to stay with the company.

## Employee Attrition 

Attrition in human resources refers to the gradual loss of employees over time and is one of the complex challenges that the people managers and the HR department have to deal with. In general, relatively high attrition is problematic for companies. For every company it's important and challenging to keep the employees happy and satisfied. If an employee you have invested much time and money leaves the company, this would mean that you would have to spend even more time and money to hire somebody else.

**In this notebook the goal is to predict if an employee will leave the company or not (employee attrition).**

So what is Attrition and what determines it? Attrition: It is basically the turnover rate of employees inside an organization.

This can happen for many reasons e.g.:

* Employees looking for better opportunities
* A negative working environment
* Bad management
* Sickness of an employee
* Excessive working hours

## Notebook 
**In this notebook I'll use a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists (from kaggle) and I'll start with:**

* **Setup & getting a feeling for my data (EDA)**: Exploring the dataset by taking a look at each feature, how correlated one feature is to the other and create some visualisations
* **Feature Engineering**: Conduct some feature engineering as well as encode all our categorical features into dummy variables
* **Machine Learning models**: The following models will be performend
  * Random Forest
  * Logistic Regression
  * KNN
  * Decision Tree
  * AdaBoost
  * XGBoost

## Keep in mind 

In the end predictive analytics and AI can help and in several cases is already helping by providing human decision-makers with objective, qualitative and standardized data from which they can make unbiased decisions. So, we know that AI has a high degree of quality in its predictions (e.g. Study: [AI faster, more accurate than humans at analyzing heart scans](https://smarttelecardiology.com/blog/178/ai-is-quicker-and-more-accurate-than-humans-in-analyzing-heart-scans/) or [Man against machine: AI is better than dermatologists at diagnosing skin cancer](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180528190839.htm)). But when it comes to HR work it must also yield for example objectivity. So I wanna say that I know technology is very powerful but it canâ€™t solve every HR problem and we need to keep the ethical aspect always in mind.
